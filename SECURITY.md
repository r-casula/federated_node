# Security Policy

The PHEMS Federated Node is designed to run in environments that process
sensitive health data, so we take security reports seriously and appreciate
responsible disclosure.

## Supported versions

| Version        | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Latest release (`main`) | :white_check_mark: |
| Older releases | We do not support older releases, please upgrade where possible |


## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub
issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report them privately using one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** (preferred): go to the
   [Security tab](https://github.com/r-casula/PHEMS_federated_node/security)
   of this repository and select **"Report a vulnerability"**.
2. **Email**: send details to **opensource@aridhia.com** with a subject
   line starting `[SECURITY]`.


Please include as much of the following as you can:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof-of-concept
- The version/commit affected
- Any suggested mitigation, if known

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **10 business days**.
- We will investigate and aim to provide an initial assessment (severity and
  next steps) within **20 business days**.
- We will keep you informed of progress until the issue is resolved.
- We will credit reporters who wish to be credited once a fix is released,
  unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Disclosure policy

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and
address a reported issue before any public disclosure, and that you avoid
accessing or modifying data belonging to others while investigating.

## Scope

This policy covers the code in this repository. If you've found an issue in
a third-party dependency (e.g. Keycloak, Traefik, the Common API),
please also report it to the relevant upstream project.
