# PHEMS - Federated Node

[PHEMS](https://phems.eu/) (short for "Pediatric Hospitals as European drivers for multi-party computation and synthetic data generation capabilities across clinical specialities and data types") is a Europe-wide consortium of paediatric hospitals that:

> ...aims to revolutionize the way health data is managed and utilized across Europe. This project is particularly focused on addressing the challenges posed by privacy concerns and the complexity of data sharing due to varying interpretations of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By developing a decentralized and open health data ecosystem, PHEMS strives to facilitate easier access to health data, thereby advancing federated health data analysis and creating services for generating shareable synthetic datasets.

As a technical partner of the project Aridhia has developed the Federated Node an open source component for running federated tasks.

## Project

The Federated Node is based on three existing open source projects:

- [The Common API](https://github.com/federated-data-sharing/common-api/tree/master)
- [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak)
- [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik)

The Common API provides the structure of the API calls, Keycloak is used for token and user management, and Traefik is used as a reverse proxy. The FN needs to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, and requires a Postgres database for storing user credentials.

| 1a   | Before creating the task pod, the FN checks if the docker image needed can be found in any of the docker container registries associated with the FN |
| 1b   | The task pod is created and the results are saved in the storage account                                                                             |
| 2    | On /results calls, if the task pod is on completed status, a job is created.                                                                         |
| 3    | The job's pod will have the 2 storage environments mounted. It fetches the tasks result folder and zips it                                           |
| 4    | The webserver reads the zip contents from the live job pod and saves it in its own storage account environment.                                      |
| 5    | The resulting archive is returned to the end user                                                                                                    |

## Development

### Dependency Management

Python dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml` files within each component directory (e.g. `webserver/`, `build/db-connector/`, `build/alpine/`, `build/kc-init/`). Locked `requirements.txt` files are generated from these using [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/) via the `pip_compile` Makefile target.

#### Prerequisites

Install `pip-tools` in your local environment:

```bash
python -m pip install pip-tools
```

#### Locking Requirements

Run `make pip_compile` with the target component directory as an argument:

```bash
# Lock dependencies for the webserver
make pip_compile webserver

# Lock dependencies for a build component
make pip_compile build/db-connector
```

By default this writes `requirements.txt` in the given directory. To write to a different output file, pass it as a second positional argument:

```bash
make pip_compile webserver requirements-dev.txt
```

Any additional flags supported by `pip-compile` can be appended after the directory (and optional output file) arguments.
To view the default flags see `scripts/pip-compile.sh`.

#### Modifying Dependencies

1. Edit the `dependencies` list in the relevant `pyproject.toml`. Use `[project.optional-dependencies]` for dev/test-only extras.
2. Re-run `make pip_compile <dir>` to regenerate the locked `requirements.txt`.
3. Commit both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.

Use `~=` (compatible-release) specifiers in `pyproject.toml` to constrain the minor version while allowing patch updates, e.g. `"flask~=3.1.3"`. The locked `requirements.txt` pins exact versions with hashes for reproducible installs.

### Linting

#### Dockerfile linting

[hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) lints all `Dockerfile`s in the project. It runs inside Docker, so no local installation is required beyond Docker itself.

```bash
make hadolint
```

This prints any issues directly to the terminal in a readable format. It also writes a JUnit XML report to `artifacts/hadolint.xml`, which is consumed by CI.
